# Contents of the repository

 

The role of the repository is to organize the digital long-term publication and storage of R-Nanolabâ€™s newsletters. We might identify further uses for Github, and this file will be accordingly updated.

 


## Newsletter-Archive

 

This folder maintains active links to all newsletters from 2023 onwards.
To access the newsletters please go into the folder and open the newsletters.md file. 
 

## Newsletter-html-backup

 

This folder is used to maintain the HTML code that has been produced by Mailchimp during the original newsletter production.
